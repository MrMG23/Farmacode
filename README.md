## Background
Over seven million patients are affected each year by medication errors that are preventable. These errors come at a cost of approximately $20 billion dollars . The cost of medication errors is not only monetary every year, approximately 7.000 people die due to these errors. A vital step in improving patient safety is to increase medication administration safety. Barcode scanning systems can do this. This project holds significance to nursing practice because it increases patient safety. Using a BCMA scanning system assists nurses in assuring that six of the seven rights are met before administration of medication. Using this technology can help nurses avoid errors affecting the patient.

## Project Goals
This application is intended to complete the final project of the Bangkit Program in particular and is expected to be an alternative in solving problems in the fields that we stretcher.
